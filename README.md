# Energy-Forecasting-Models
The project is Electrical Energy Forecasting due to Heatwaves by using Machine Learning. Here I built a predictive model for future climate change scenarios with electricity energy usage. <br><br>
1.	Contributions
•	To estimate accurate energy demand needed in future with heatwaves
•	To find out how much additional energy needed in future with heatwaves
<br><br>
2.	Dataset
•	Data are collected from meteorological department (Weather parameter data) and Ampara grid substation (Electricity consumption data)
<br><br>
3.	Data Preprocessing
•	Cleaned the data set by removing data with missing values.
•	Used Pandas library to identify heatwaves and calculate related electricity consumptions due to cooling devices.
•	Identified important features for the analysis by using Pearson correlation analysis.<br><br>
4.	Energy forecasting with regression
•	Tried with SVR (Support Vector Regression) and RF (Random Forest) models <br><br>
5.	Results
•	Best performance model: Random Forest
•	MSE (Mean Squared Error): 1.79%
•	MAE (Mean Absolute Error): 9.34%
•	RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error): 11.79% <br><br>

6.	Publications
•	Completed the research paper.
•	Paper submitted for two conferences. <br><br>
